# Why?

That's the biggest question that I have ever faced. Bakit nangyayari ito sakin. Paulit ulit ko na din itong tinanong sa sarili ko nung mga panahong nahihirapan ako.

Ang pinaka magandang rason na nakita ko along the way ay binigay ni Lord itong pagsubok na ito sa akin kasi alam kong malalampasan ko ito at para mas maging mabuti akong tao. 

God, fate or any higher being that you believe in lets us experience our pain because it makes us stronger and better. We could endure greater pain in the future and learn from it. But we do not only live just to experience pain but also to enjoy life and everything that comes with it. 

Through our darkest times, we should help ourselves to find light, hope and joy even if it only shines a little. We should be grateful for what is and what is not, what we have and what we have not. There are a lot of things going on in our life right now. You're feeling lost and grieving in your current situation but don't forget that this too will pass and you will experience joy once more.
