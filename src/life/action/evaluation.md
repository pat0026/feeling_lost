# Evaluation

Ngayon na aware ka sa nararamdaman mo. Ang kasunod mong gawin ay i-revaluate yung current state mo. In means of kung ano ginagawa mo araw araw, anong mga habits meron ka at kung paano mo din ginagawa ang mga bagay na ito.

I-revaluate mo yung choices mo na ginawa ngayong araw. Kahit mag focus ka lang muna sa araw na ito. Wag mo na muna isipin ang mga nakaraan mong ginagawa.

You could revaluate your choices in the following list:
- [ ] Does this help you to enhance your skills?
- [ ] Does this help reach your long-term goals?
- [ ] Does this help you uplift your feelings in the long run?
- [ ] Does this help you to become a healthy and fit person(physically/mentally)?
- [ ] Does this help the ones dear in your heart in any way?
- [ ] Does this lessen your dependency on others and helps you stand on your own two feet?
- [ ] When you look back to yesterday or a year after, will you not regret using your time and energy in this choice?
- [ ] This choice is for your long-term happiness, not short-term happiness(pagkatapos mong gawin, agad agad na nawawala yung saya)
- [ ] If this will take you longer than you expect, will you still commit to this choice even if you're mood changes on it?
- [ ] Does this choice make you a lesser version of myself(Bumabalik ka sa dating habit, maslumala pa or ma-acquire mo pa lang)

If you did not check almost half of the things on this list, you should try to remove/change this choice/habit by taking baby step actions. Please read on.

This list may increase and is susceptible to modification.

Tip: Even though life is short and we do not know when our time is up, you should still live and choose wisely. Use your time and energy efficiently. Choose **long-term** instead of short-term choices if you know that they will help you become a better person in the long run.
