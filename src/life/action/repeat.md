# Repeat and make it a habit

Now you're making progress so just keep doing it and go with the momentum. Don't let your efforts be wasted. Repeat it the next day. Make it a habit. Know which actions you want to do for the next day, next week or even next year. If it really works for you, why not do it forever? Just create habits that will help you become a better person and change or remove the habits that hinder your growth.

You should trust the process. Ako na nagsasabi sayo na hindi mo agad makikita yung results na gusto mong mangyari pero if paunti unti mo itong gagawin, tiwala ako sayong makakamit mo kahit anuman ang gustuhin mo sa buhay. Strive to be better. If you don't want to be at the moment, then atleast strive to be good to yourself.

You should also try to practice committing to the task you have started. Don't make it a habit na madami kang nasimulan pero wala kang natatapos kahit isa. Try mo munang tapusin ang isa tapos saka mo simulan yung ibang task na sa tingin mo ay makakapagpasaya sayo or makakapagpabuti sayo. Just try to practice commiting and you will see the results. Mararamdaman mo yung progress along the way. Wag mo pagsabaysabayin, 2 lang kamay mo. Enjoy!
