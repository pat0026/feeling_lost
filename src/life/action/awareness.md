# Awareness

The first step you have to take is that you are aware of the problems you are now facing. You are aware of being lost and you acknowledge it. 

Don't fight it. Don't tell yourself "Why am I lost? Why is this happening to me? I shouldn't be feeling this way. Instead, tell yourself this, "I acknowledge that I'm feeling lost right now and I know for a fact that I'll find myself. Even if it takes me a long time to find myself, I'm not giving up".

By being aware you are already halfway to finding yourself. Don't belittle this step because this is a huge one.
